# class
- this created new class will extend, extentiate the react component class.
- that means the new class will have the same methods that the original class has.
- constructor get ran first


# this
- "this" refrences the context scope in which **a funciton is being invoked**


# bind(this, )
- defines what "this" is of the function
```js
this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
```

# arrow function
- sets "this" automatically when the function is defined
- using without bind().

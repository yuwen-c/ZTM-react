## Mounting phase
- the first time the component shows on the dom
- run constructor first (super)
- the evaluation of what is going to render happens in render part.
- then react updates dom and refs
- trigger `componentDidMount`

## Updating phase
- update the component when props gets changed
- mounting a component is costly, but selectively change piece of html code is way more easily
- setState will also trigger re-render
- `componentDidUpdate`

### shouldComponentUpdate
- if the component re-render, the children will get re-render too.
- for performance concern, if there is no need to re-render the component, use this lify cycle method
- receives `nextProps`, `nextState` parameters
- return boolean to set if the component needs to be re-rendered or not.


## Unmounting phase
- firebase
- `componentWillUnmount`
- remove anything that will cause memory leak
